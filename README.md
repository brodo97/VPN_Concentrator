# VPN Concentrator

Turn ON/OFF different VPN from a single point!

You like VPNs uh? But you don't want to keep the tunnels open all the time, for whatever reason:

- Security
- Bandwidth
- You name it, I don't care

Use this Telegram Bot!

It can be installed on multiple devices simultaneously!

### How it works

Run the script from a scheduler.

The bot get the new chat updates.

If it sees its name and a /vpnon: **the vpn will turn on**

And if it sees a /vpnoff: **it will turn off**

So simple!
